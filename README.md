# RLCard: A Toolkit for Reinforcement Learning in Card Games

This is a fork of https://github.com/elipugh/euchre witch is a fork of [rlcard](https://github.com/datamllab/rlcard) with added Euchre environments and updated PyTorch agents so you can use RLCard to train agents for Euchre!  Most of the Euchre environment comes from [this repo](https://github.com/mbrine555/euchre_rl), but it has been heavily modified to work with DQN and NFSP agents.

# My project:
In this repo, I develop an agent to play euchre using the Monte Carlo Tree Search Method. The bulk of the algorithm is locaded in rlcard/agents/euchre_mcts.py, with additional functions being defined for it in game.py, env.py, judger.py and euchre.py
