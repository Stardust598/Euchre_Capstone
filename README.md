# RLCard: A Toolkit for Reinforcement Learning in Card Games

This is a fork of [rlcard](https://github.com/datamllab/rlcard) with added Euchre environments and updated PyTorch agents so you can use RLCard to train agents for Euchre!  Most of the Euchre environment comes from [this repo](https://github.com/mbrine555/euchre_rl), but it has been heavily modified to work with DQN and NFSP agents.

This is also a project for the Stanford class AA228, Decision Making Under Uncertainty.  You can check out the final report [here](paper.pdf)
